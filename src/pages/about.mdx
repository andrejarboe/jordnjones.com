# Hi! I'm Jordan

I'm a fullstack JavaScript engineer and UI designer based in
Kingston, Jamaica. Born and raised in Junction, St.Elizabeth, I was
always interested in computers and how stuff worked. After I
graduated [High School](http://manchesterhighschooljm.com/),
I attended the [University of Technology](https://www.utech.edu.jm/)
where I graduated with a
Bachelor of Science in Computing with a major in Computer Science.

I've written code for [X Team](https://x-team.com/), [Alteroo](https://www.alteroo.com/),
[The Palisadoes Foundation](http://www.palisadoes.org/),
[UWI Mona Student Guild](https://www.mona.uwi.edu/content/guild-students),
[JIFFS](https://jifsjm.org/), [Fly Jamaica](https://fly-jamaica.com/) and
did _a lot_ of open source code for [Project Calico](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation).

<b>I currently work full time at [KavPRO](https://kavpro.xyz)</b> as their Chief Technical Officer and overall moral support provider.
